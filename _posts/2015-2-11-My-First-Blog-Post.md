title: My First Post
---

Welcome, to my first blog post. This all sounds a little childish is many ways... my first *this*... my first *that*... but I am hoping that this blog can overcome the often self-indulgent opinions that many blogs can possess. If I can write a few interesting words, a few musing, that can interest somebody outside my world then I will have achieved my goal. 

So the first big question is, what to write about? Where do I start?

* building this blog
* cycling - a great passion of mine
* skiing, and St Anton - another big interest
* or something else...?

##Building this blog

For a few months now I have been thinking that I should start a blog. The main reason, if I am honest, is promotion of my programming work. In the last year I have undertaken the task to improve my programming skills, which has taken on a journey that has including building android apps. And what better place to present this work than on a blog.

I rather stumbled across the blog hosting that Github provide during a conversation with a friend. Given my desire to show case my programming, this felt like a natural place to start.

The process of creating the site is exceptionally simple. As simple as creating a repository with the correct hosting name `<username>.github.io`. From here, its a case of commiting your blog source files to the repository.

But what do i design the blog with? There are a number of free online tools and hosting sites, the favourite of course being WordPress. But with the GitHub ecosystem there are a number of easy to integrate repositories. I opted for an easy to implement version of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) called [JekyllNow](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). A simple forking of the source repository, a few changes to the configuration file, and hey-presto a fully fucntioning markdown enabled blog.

The next step is a simple understanding of markdown syntax. This is probably the easiest part of publishing a blog, but for those interested, a good resource on the syntax can be found [here on github](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 

This is only my first post, and I have yet to adjust the UI (something I hope to do in time), but so far, I have been impressed with the ease with which this blog has been produced.
