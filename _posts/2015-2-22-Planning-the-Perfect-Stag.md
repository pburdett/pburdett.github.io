title: Planning the Perfect Stag
---

Planning a stag do can seem like a daunting process, after all it is the Stag's big send off. So where do you start with the planning? Who? What? Where? When? All key questions that need answering, and on the most part, they all rely on each other.

###Who?
The 'who' part is the hardest for the Stag to answer. Family politics, different friendship groups, should you invite your father, and maybe even the father-in-law-to-be? The only person that can answer these is the Stag himself. My one piece of advice for a successful stag is, less is more. If you are finding the Stag saying "maybe Bob?" then perhaps Bob is one person too many.
